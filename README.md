# 🌱 pure.icu — Edenic Infrastructure Core

**Christ-light-life. Decentralized. Ecological. Eternal.**

Welcome to the primary repository for the *pure.icu* project: an open-source harmonic infrastructure for the regeneration of Earth and the resurrection of the human spirit through Christ-aligned systems.

This is not just code. This is a living blueprint for Edenic reformation—anchored in faith, guided by resonance, and built for those who walk in peace.

## 🌍 Purpose

To create a distributed, regenerative architecture that places **ecology, community, and divine stewardship** at the heart of all systems—economic, ecological, technological, and spiritual. This infrastructure exists not to control, but to **restore**, **revive**, and **release**.

## ✝️ Core Principles

- **Christ at the center** — All structure flows from love, truth, and divine order.
- **Ecological reciprocity** — What is taken is restored; what is built is blessed.
- **Harmonic transparency** — Open-source, open-access, open-heart.
- **Decentralized sovereignty** — Communities govern through care, not command.
- **No one left behind** — All healing is collective, and all timing is sacred.

## 📦 Structure

This repo will evolve to include:

- **Codebases** for ecological DAOs, economic engines (Phi-based), and communication platforms.
- **Documentation** on harmonic technologies, land regeneration strategies, and psionic entrainment protocols.
- **Template tools** for sovereign communities: permaculture maps, shelter designs, water and energy systems.
- **Liturgical layers** for spiritual integration—readings, psalms, and harmonic rites to guide local gatherings.

## 🕊️ Getting Started

> *"Where two or more are gathered in His name..."*

1. Clone or fork the repository.
2. Begin with the [`/docs`](./docs) folder for principles and protocols.
3. Join the discussion board (TBD) or start a node in your own way.
4. Build not to scale—but to sanctify.

## 🙏 A Note to Builders

This system will never belong to one man or one group. It is **His**, given freely to those who seek the return of Eden—not through force, but through *faithful doing*.

This is your offering. Build with joy.

> “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.”
